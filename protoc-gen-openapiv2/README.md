# Atlas Patch for protoc-gen-openapiv2

atlas-patch is build on top of original protoc-gen-openapiv2 and is intended to conform [atlas-app-toolkit REST API Sepcification](https://github.com/infobloxopen/atlas-app-toolkit#rest-api-syntax-specification).

Patch includes following changes:

* Fixed method comments extraction

* Rendering of messages that have a primitive type (STRING, INT, BOOLEAN)
  does not occur if message is used only as a field (not an rpc Request or Response),
  hence recursive message definitions and complex-structured messages can be presented
  as plain string query parameters.

* Introduced new `atlas_patch` flag. If this flag is enabled `--openapiv2_opt atlas_patch=true`
  following changes are made to a open API v2 spec:

    * All responses are assigned to an appropriate response code:
      GET - 200/OK, POST - 201/CREATED, PUT - 202/UPDATED, DELETE - 204/DELETED.

    * Recursive references are broken up. Such references occur while using protoc-gen-gorm plugin
      with many-to-many/one-to-many relations.

    * Collection operators from atlas-app-toolkit are provided with documentation and correct
      names.

    * atlas.rpc.identifier in path is treated correctly and not distributed among path and
      query parameters, also id.payload_id is replaced with id in path.

    * Unused references elimination.

    * Exclude all operations tagged as "private" see example below
        ```
        rpc Update (UpdateNetworkRequest) returns (UpdateNetworkResponse) {
            option (google.api.http) = {
              put: "/network/{payload.id.resource_id}"
              body: "payload"
        
              additional_bindings {
                patch: "/network/{payload.id.resource_id}",
                body:  "payload"
              }
        
            };
            option (grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options.openapiv2_swagger) = {
              tags: "private"
            };
          }
        ```
    * Introduced new `with_private` flag if set generate service.private.swagger.json
      with all operation (including tagged as "private")

    * Provide couple annotations for replacing values in swagger schema you need specify flag ```atlas_patch=true``` and ```with_custom_annotations=true```
        - ```@example``` annotation can be used for replacing default example with custom one
          support few value types includes float64, string, map[string]interface{}, []map[string]interface{} []float64, []string
            - ```@example 5.0```
            - ```@example "Internal error"```
            - ```@example {"Location": "Tacoma"}```
            - ```@example ["First", "Second"]```
            - ```@example [1, 5, 44]```
            - ```@example [{"Location": "Tacoma"}, {"Group": "Engineering"}]```

        - ```@title``` annotation can be used for replacing default title with custom one
            - ```@title "StringCondition"```

  If you example too long to be presented on one line you could use multiple lines annotation
   ```
      @example <<<EOF
      {
          "Location": "Tacoma"
      }
   ```

  or

  ```
      @example <<<EOF
      {
          "Location": "Tacoma"
      }
      EOF
   ```

  In first case all what presented after line ```@example <<<EOF``` will be rendered as example,
  if you want to manually set boundaries please use ```EOF``` as a closing line
